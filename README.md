This ModJam Mod is called MMLMC. Basicaly, you can create music ingame using ComputerCraft computers with the Petit Computer MML Format. It is very simple to use, and I plan to add an ingame IDE that runs on Advanced Computers. I also plan to create some music and a music player, the ability to "burn" music to a Floppy Disk, and even streaming music over Rednet! This mod is going to be big, and it will add another entertainment option to Minecraft!
